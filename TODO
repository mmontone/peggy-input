- Improve completion of certain lists (for instance, completion of users and groups as user types. Hint: look at partialInput). Bug: partial input of completions that have a space character doesn't work well.
- Check performance for lots of completion candidates. ~10K
- A way of specifying server-side filtering of completion candidates.
- Use a typechecking library for validating the api? (https://github.com/gkz/type-check). Check out more advanced zod, joi or yup.
- Use NPM instead or Make for building the library and running the demo?
- Completion matching options. Case-sensitive, prefix matcher, substring matcher, etc.
- Implement tests. Use webdriver?
- Make completion case-insensitive.

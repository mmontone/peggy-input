- Improve completion of certain lists (for instance, completion of users and groups as user types. Hint: look at partialInput).
- Consider dropping JQuery and use native JS ?
- Completion data with ids? i.e. username + id
- Check performance for lots of completion candidates. ~10K
- Make completions list clickable.
- Get current status of the completion input via Javascript. error, result, etc.
- Better tuning of error status visually. Toggleable error message. Add CSS class to input field. Is there a way of marking an input element as invalid?

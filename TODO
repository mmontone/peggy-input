- Improve completion of certain lists (for instance, completion of users and groups as user types. Hint: look at partialInput).
- Consider dropping JQuery and use native JS ?
- Completion data with ids? i.e. username + id
- Check performance for lots of completion candidates. ~10K
- Get current status of the completion input via Javascript. error, result, etc.
- Better tuning of error status visually. Toggleable error message. Add CSS class to input field. Is there a way of marking an input element as invalid?
- A way of specifying server-side filtering of completion candidates.
- Use a typechecking library for validating the api?
- When handling lots of completion candidates, it could make sense to show the completion list only after a few characters have been typed, so a filtered list is ensured. This could be specified in global options, or in the completers options.
